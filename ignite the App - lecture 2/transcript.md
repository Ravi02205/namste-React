● - What is `NPM`?
==> it is package manager which manages the Package for installation and transitive dependency

● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
==> parcel/webpack are the bundlers . we need to use it because when we need a production ready app we need to
        minify the code
        optimize it
        clear the console 
        bundle the code 
        caching and etc 
        so for all this stuff we need the bundler.

● - What is `.parcel-cache` ?
==> parcel-cache is folder which contains the cache for all the files in the project when it got changed and all the details it take care of reloading when it changes

● - What is `npx` ?
==> npx is command which says that execute this with npm 

● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
==> dependency are packages are where global one which will be included in development env and production Environment also 
    devDependency packages are which are used in development env only it will not included in the production
Environment  

● - What is Tree Shaking?
==>  In production builds, Parcel statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used. This is called "tree shaking" or "dead code elimination".

● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
==> hot module replacement is 


● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
==> MINIFICATION
    BUNDLING
    IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
    dev and prod build
    hot module replace 

    ==> minification ==> it does minification for all the js files replace the variable with other names and 
                        minify the code and it makes it other user to unreadable.and make it all in one line.
    ==> bundling ==> it takes all the js file or css or html files which will be held together and bundled in
                        one file for js or css or html.
    ==> DEV AND PROD BUILD ==> it takes the prod build which is normal and optimize it and dev build for 
                               optimized and minified it.

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
==> .gitignore file contains the list of files which should not go to github repo. which is not included in
    the production also.
    so we take files which can be reproduce from code and which can be handled on the server side. 
     


● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
==> package.json -> it contains all the list of packages of which are dev dependency and dependencies also used and it makes the packages to be upgraded to new versions it self and manage the transitive dependency also.
    package-lock.json -> it contains all the list of packages of which are used for development and transitive dependency also and exact version of package which is getting used for the development 

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
==> It is a generated file and is not designed to be manually edited. Its purpose is to track the entire tree of dependencies (including dependencies of dependencies) and the exact version of each dependency

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
==> node_modules contains all the required modules(packages) in the development of an web app. it is not good idea because it contains the more space and it can be regenerated by npm install command.

● - What is the `dist` folder?
==> dist folder is created by parcel when we create a build it means it contains the file like development ready build or production ready build files in that which is cached on the first build and after that it will take lesser time to create the build based on cache.

● - What is `browserlists`
==> browserlist is package which defines that my web app where it should be compatible to newer and older versions of browser we can use multiple things and it takes as a string only 
    browserlist.dev is link where we can do the experiement with the list.

==>~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, will update you to all future patch versions, without    
            incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <1.3.0.

    ^version “Compatible with version”, will update you to all future minor/patch versions, without 
            incrementing the major version. ^2.3.4 will use releases from 2.3.4 to <3.0.0.
