● - What is `NPM`?
==> it is package manager which manages the Package for installation and transitive dependency

● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
==> parcel/webpack are the bundlers . we need to use it because when we need a production ready app we need to
        minify the code
        optimize it
        clear the console 
        bundle the code 
        caching and etc 
        so for all this stuff we need the bundler.

● - What is `.parcel-cache` ?
==> parcel-cache is folder which contains the cache for all the files in the project when it got changed and all the details it take care of reloading when it changes

● - What is `npx` ?
==> npx is command which says that execute this with npm 

● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
==> dependency are packages are where global one which will be included in development env and production Environment also 
    devDependency packages are which are used in development env only it will not included in the production
Environment  

● - What is Tree Shaking?
==>  In production builds, Parcel statically analyzes the imports and exports of each module, and removes everything that isn't used. This is called "tree shaking" or "dead code elimination".

● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
==> hot module replacement is 


● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
==> MINIFICATION
    BUNDLING
    IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
    dev and prod build
    hot module replace 

    ==> minification ==> it does minification for all the js files replace the variable with other names and 
                        minify the code and it makes it other user to unreadable.and make it all in one line.
    ==> bundling ==> it takes all the js file or css or html files which will be held together and bundled in
                        one file for js or css or html.
    ==> DEV AND PROD BUILD ==> it takes the prod build which is normal and optimize it and dev build for 
                               optimized and minified it.

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
==> .gitignore file contains the list of files which should not go to github repo. which is not included in
    the production also.
    so we take files which can be reproduce from code and which can be handled on the server side. 
     


● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
==> package.json -> it contains all the list of packages of which are dev dependency and dependencies also used and it makes the packages to be upgraded to new versions it self and manage the transitive dependency also.
    package-lock.json -> it contains all the list of packages of which are used for development and transitive dependency also and exact version of package which is getting used for the development 

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
==> It is a generated file and is not designed to be manually edited. Its purpose is to track the entire tree of dependencies (including dependencies of dependencies) and the exact version of each dependency

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
==> node_modules contains all the required modules(packages) in the development of an web app. it is not good idea because it contains the more space and it can be regenerated by npm install command.

● - What is the `dist` folder?
==> dist folder is created by parcel when we create a build it means it contains the file like development ready build or production ready build files in that which is cached on the first build and after that it will take lesser time to create the build based on cache.

● - What is `browserlists`
==> browserlist is package which defines that my web app where it should be compatible to newer and older versions of browser we can use multiple things and it takes as a string only 
    browserlist.dev is link where we can do the experiement with the list.

Read about dif bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel

● Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilda
==>~version “Approximately equivalent to version”, will update you to all future patch versions, without    
            incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to <1.3.0.

    ^version “Compatible with version”, will update you to all future minor/patch versions, without 
            incrementing the major version. ^2.3.4 will use releases from 2.3.4 to <3.0.0.

● Read about Script types in html (MDN Docs)

command to initialize the npm ==> npm init
what it creates ==> package.json
package.json ==> used to manage the dependencies ! 
                Two Types of Dependencies ==> devDependencies, dependencies 
                devDependencies ==> used only for development Environment
                dependencies ==> used in all the development Environment and Production also 
                browserList ==> help us to convert our code into different browser version 
                                in older versions doesnt have the defination of some code then 
                                    that functionality might not run so browserlist will add the defination by using the pollyfill.
pollyfill ==> our modern js code convert into older code that is what pollyfill is
ES6 => ecma script 6
do we need to write the pollyfill ==> no Babel write it for ourself.
so what is babel => js package

super Powers of Parcel --> optimizing the js code and images 
                           budling and minifying 
                           hot module replacement ==> reload the page it self 
                           file watcher ==> to watch the files which are being changed 
                           caching 
                           comperession 
                           HTTPS on dev
                           port no
                           consistant hashing algorithm 
                           Zero Config 
                           
Tree shaking ==> removing unwanted code 
             => we have added some library or frame work it has multiple functions but we are using one or two of them so parcel removes the code which is not being used.

how can you build a performant scalable app ==> we need to explain why my app is faster and this parcel functionality is same as this one. so we will say those functionalities.


command use to run this project ==> npx parcel index.html

npx ==> executing the package or library without downloading it. ==> npx == npm run 

now we have added the commands in script tag we can use it as 
    npm run start
    npm run build

we can ignore the run and directly write the  npm start ==> work only for start script only 

<!--  parcel don;t remove the console.log  -->
we need to add the configuration for removing the console.log 
which is babel plugin transform runtime remove console 
    ===> babel-plugin-transform-remove-console

for dev dependency we can use --> npm install babel-plugin-transform-remove-console --save-dev
    we can use -d also 

just installing it wont work ! so we need to configure it with our project ==> 
    .babelrc ==> configuration for babel ==> this is the babel library 

we need to create .babelrc ==> configuration for babel ==> go to documentation and add the config into that

every time creating a new bundle remove the dist folder it is good thing.


suppose if we have div and has two childrens h1 and h2 ==> so we need to give then unique keys 
in react we need to give keys in props object 

if we have an array as a children we need to give the keys to those children

<!-- Todo :- why we need to give the keys ==> read about reconciliation ==> diffing algorithm -->
<!-- suppose we have ul and has two li -->

<ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
</ul>
<!-- if we add it in the end it will be okay for react it will add and react will render it and update it  -->
<ul>
    <li>3</li>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
</ul>

<!-- if we add it in the top there will be so much process needed for react to update this he need to rerender whole dom tree  -->

something updating in DOM -> render

so to stop this re rendering then we need to add the unique key so react can identify the unique key and manage the difference and update the DOM.



 <!-- TODO : what is difference between JSX and HTML ?   -->
 <!-- TODO : usage of JSX, multiple tags inside JSX, create img tag in jsx  -->
 <!-- TODO : Babel does more things we need to check into babel.com  -->




 advantages of JSX ==>
    readablity 
    developer experience
    syntactical sugar 
    less code 
    mantainablity 
    no repeatation 


React Component ==> 
    - functional Component - NEW
    - Class Based Component - OLD 

functional component is nothing but a function A simple JS Function 

Name of component start with Capital Letter => Not mandatory ==> but normal convection ==> good practise
